# WorldBattle

In the 23rd century the war between two empires led to a nuclear apocalypse which led to
extinction of nearly all civilization and animal life. As we are the only survivors we are trying to build
a new civilization but resources required to sustain life are rare. The radioactivity makes outdoors
dangerous. We are living in an old bunker that is left from WW2. Volunteers need to get out to the
dangerous lands and get to the places where they can get resources. Luckily the bunker we are
living has an old radar that can find creatures on our path to the resources. As a surviving engineer
you are required to write a simulation that can simulate if a volunteer can reach to resources. Be
aware that our radar indicates that there are dangerous creatures and even zombies on the
wasteland.
Write a simulation that find outs if the hero would survive or not. You can use the following sample
input and output as a reference. If the volunteer hero faces an enemy he needs to fight against it
until one of them dies. To simulate fights you can accept that enemy and the hero attack at the
same time. hp represents health points. Each attack decreases health points equal to attack. To
avoid radioactivity volunteer hero wears a special heavy armor that makes him walk meter by
meter.


This project was built using basic object oriented programming components. These are encapsulation, abstraction,
* inheritance and polymorphism. Factory Pattern is used to produce objects. The characters created with the Factory
* Pattern have been expanded in a common class, which is an abstract class. And using the interfaces, each character's
* behavior is controlled. Results are written to a results.txt file by performing logical operations on the Main Class.
* It would be more useful to use the generic method that contains non-constant characters for both types that will
* fight the logical method. For this reason, the generic method is not used.
*
* Intellij Idea is used for this project.
